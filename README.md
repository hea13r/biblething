# biblething

This project is meant to pull scripture from github.com/wldeh/bible-api and output only the text, without the chapter and verse numbers.
It's really just a personal project, because I want to read the books of the bible as books instead of a bible for a new perspective.

It requires importing request and json.

It will output a file wherever it is run.
